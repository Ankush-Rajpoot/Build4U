# Payment System Test Guide

## Overview
The payment system is currently configured for **TESTING MODE ONLY**. No real money will be transferred.

## Testing Configuration

### Backend (.env)
```
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID=TEST_CLIENT_ID_REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL
CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET=TEST_CLIENT_SECRET_REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL
PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE=5
```

### Test Mode Features
- All payments are simulated
- No real bank accounts required
- Mock bank details are used if worker hasn't set up bank details
- Visual indicators show "TEST MODE" in the UI
- Console logs show payment simulation details

## How to Test

### 1. Create a Service Request (Client)
- Login as a client
- Create a new service request with a budget
- Post the request

### 2. Accept Request (Worker)
- Login as a worker
- Find the service request
- Send a proposal
- Wait for client to accept

### 3. Start Work (Worker)
- Once accepted, start the work
- Status changes to "in-progress"

### 4. Request Payment (Worker)
- Click "Request Payment" button on the job card
- Enter amount and description
- Submit payment request

### 5. Approve Payment (Client)
- Login as client
- View pending payment requests
- Approve or decline the request

### 6. View Payment History
- Both client and worker can view:
  - Budget overview
  - Payment requests
  - Transaction history
  - Remaining budget

## Test Data
In test mode, the system uses these mock bank details:
```
Account Number: 1234567890
IFSC Code: TEST0000001
Bank Name: Test Bank
```

## Console Logs
Watch the backend console for test payment logs:
```
[Payment] Cashfree Service initialized in TEST mode
[Payment Test] Simulating payout: â‚¹1000 to John Doe
[Payment Test] Checking status for transfer: TXN_1234567890_abc123
```

## Moving to Production
To enable real payments:
1. Get actual Cashfree credentials
2. Set `CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production` in .env
3. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
4. Workers must add real bank details
5. Test with small amounts first

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/payments/history/:serviceRequestId` - Get payment history
- `GET /api/payments/stats` - Get user payment statistics

## Payment Flow
